                                <p>In 2022, Terminal was focused on increasing the supply of remote full-time engineers for our talent marketplace. Our Growth Team generated a 200% cumulative conversion uplift through experimentation and by the end of 2022, helping more remote engineers land life-changing US based jobs. </p>
                                <p>I was the main designer working on growth-focused initiatives, collaborating daily with a lead product manager, the Growth Marketing team, and 3 engineers. </p>

                                        <p>Data from Mixpanel and FullStory showed that 80% of users were dropping after the first step in our registration flow. We were asking users to immediately create an account, which is a big commitment upfront.</p>
                                        <p>Our first hypothesis was that users were being prompted to create an account too soon, adding too much friction to the experience with little value. We launched an A/B test, moving the account creation to the last step of registration, which resulted in significant increase in top of funnel conversion and shortly released to all users in Q2.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>We also hypothesized that introducing value and enough context about our offering earlier in the registration flow would help generate buy-in from users.</p> 
                                    <p>After seeing success with our user tests, we released an experiment targeting the first step of registration to 50% of website visitors. This experiment that aimed to provide value upfront to users with a preview of our jobs, proved to be unsuccessful in improving conversion.</p>

                                    <p>Fortunately, our second experiment which tested two new entry-points to our registration flow on our website based on user feedback regarding lack of context of who Terminal is despite seeing available jobs, was a success and released to production in Q3 - check it out <a href="https://www.terminal.io/engineers">here.</a></p>

                                        <p>Fullstory recordings and user testing taught us that users were frustrated with filling out their work experience as a step in our registration flow, especially on mobile web. Improving the top of funnel conversion wouldn't mean much if our users experience too much friction to complete their account creation. </p>
                                        <p>Our solution was to give users the choice to provide their LinkedIn profile or manually add experience, instead of only offering manual entry. This experiment had two benefits, less friction for users to add their experience and better overall conversion for the business.</p>

                                        <p>Job matches are a significant value proposition during our sign-up flow. However, user research taught us that many candidates prefer to see available jobs before signing up on a website like Terminal.  </p>
                                        <p>We built a job board available outside Terminal’s platform which lets users browse jobs before signing up. This project spanned across both desktop and mobile web provided a new sign-up pathway for some users as well as significantly improved our SEO ranking - check out the job board <a href="https://www.terminal.io/engineers/job-openings" target="blank">here</a>.</p>

                                        <p>One of the challenges of this project was the risk of showing available jobs decreasing initial conversion. Jobs were only available upon sign-up as means to encourage users to complete registration. Though, considering how strong our signals around users wanting to see jobs was, we launched this experiment to observe if despite the potential lower initial conversion, those converting after seeing jobs may be better candidates in our down-funnel performance.</p>
